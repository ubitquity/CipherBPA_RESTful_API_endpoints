RESTful API endpoints that could be created for CipherBPA to connect to various blockchain networks (Polygon, Solana, BNBChain). These endpoints include interactions with the relevant tokens (UBQT_P on Polygon, UBQT_S on Solana, UBQT_B on BNBChain), ensuring that the system can send and receive tokens, check balances, and handle basic functionalities like transferring tokens.

NOTE: This is a basic RESTful API for the proprietary CipherBPA add-on to NFTitle Network for medium to enterprise-sized organizations. You may need to adjust according to CipherBPA's system requirements, security needs, and specific blockchain interactions.
