# CipherBPA_RESTful_API_endpoints
RESTful API endpoints that could be created for CipherBPA to connect to various blockchain networks (Polygon, Solana, BNBChain). These endpoints include interactions with the relevant tokens (UBQT_P on Polygon, UBQT_S on Solana, UBQT_B on BNBChain), ensuring that the system can send and receive tokens, check balances, etc.
